            <p>
                I'm a 19-year-old ICT & Media Design student from the vibrant city of Durban, South Africa.
                <br><br>
                My journey into the world of Art and Design began as early as I can recall. From childhood, I immersed myself in these disciplines, treating them not just as hobbies but as avenue for exploration and self-expression.
                <br><br>
                As I moved into the years of high school, my interests expanded to include technology and development. Growing up in a ‘tech-savvy’ environment exposed me to the latest innovations and created a passion for the ever-evolving landscape of the tech industry.
                <br><br>
                It became clear to me that I desired a career path that aligned with my creative instincts while remaining relevant in today's dynamic world. This realization steered me towards beginning my educational journey in ICT & Media Design.
                <br><br>
                Through this program, I've discovered a near-perfect blend of my passions and ambitions. Moreover, my journey from South Africa to Eindhoven has further fueled these aspirations. Immersing myself in a new environment known for its innovation and creativity has provided me with amazing opportunities to broaden my horizons and deepen my understanding of the digital landscape. It's about shaping a future where creativity drives innovation, allowing me to make tangible contributions to the dynamic digital realm.
