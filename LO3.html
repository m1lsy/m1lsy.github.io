    <h2>Logo Design</h2>
    <p><b>Logo Design</b> is something which I find very challenging but really enjoy. For the rebranding project for “Geldrops MuziekCorps”, it was required that we design a new logo that was <b>modern but also resonated with the client.</b> As shown in the illustrations below, the designing process was somewhat chaotic, involving playing around with any ideas that came to mind.</p>
    <p>Before working on this project, I had <b>no experience using Illustrator</b> and so it was quite <b>challenging initially.</b> I started by tracing some images of instruments to help familiarize myself with the program. I also attended an Illustrator Introduction workshop which also helped me in navigating the program and understanding the basics. </p>
    <p>I learnt the <b>importance of iterating</b> and that you should always <b>duplicate the design</b> you have before adding to it, in order to see <b>how the deisgn has evolved</b> and to have something to <b>refer back to in case of errors.</b> out my design process, iteration is visable with each design differing slightly from the previous one. </p>
    <p>Throughout the design process, I received helpful feedback from the client, my teachers and my peers. This feedback allowed me to view my work from a different perspective and helped me identify what was working and what was not. 

    For example, I asked some of my teachers who specialize in design for feedback on some of the designs below:</p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="image-container">
        <a href="GeldropLogosPDF1.pdf" class="box-link" target="_blank">
            <div class="box2">
                <h2>INITIAL LOGO IDEAS FOR GELDROPSMUZIEK CORPS PROJECT &#8599</h2>
            </div>
        </a>
        <img src="GMCLOGO1.jpg">
    </div>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>The feedback I received was positive as many liked my very stylized approach to the design. 

        Although the design worked visually, it was brought to my attention that logically, the direction of the trumpet did not make sense. If a person were to play the trumpet in my drawing, the sound would travel in the wrong direction.
        With this feedback, I decided to think of ways that would make sense logically and visually. I then created the designs below:</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="GMC2logo.jpg">
    <p>These trumpet inspired logo designs resembled the instrument more realistically while still having the same stylized elements that my previous designs had.

        I then decided to get feedback from the client in order to see if this design resonated with them.
        
        The feedback I received was positive and that they found the first design to resonate with them as a company the most. The only change they requested was for the trumpet to be a brighter yellow colour instead of the beige colour it was currently.
