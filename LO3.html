    <h2>1st Project – Rebranding (Logo Design) </h2>
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Logo design is something I find very challenging but really enjoy. For the rebranding project for “Geldrops MuziekCorps,” we were required to design a new logo that was modern but also resonated with the client. As shown in the illustrations below, the designing process was somewhat chaotic, with us playing around with any idea that came to mind.

    <h3>Initial Challenges and Learning</h3>
    <p>
        Before working on this project, I had no experience using Illustrator, so it was quite challenging initially. I started by tracing some images of instruments to help familiarize myself with the program. I also attended an Illustrator Introduction workshop, which helped me navigate the program and understand the basics.
    </p>
    <h3>Iteration and Design Process</h3>
    <p>
        I learned the importance of iterating and always duplicating the design before adding to it. This practice allows you to see how the design has evolved and to have something to refer back to in case of errors. Throughout my design process, iteration is visible, with each design differing slightly from the previous one.
    </p>
    <h3>Feedback and Refinement</h3>
    <p>
        Throughout the design process, I received helpful feedback from the client, my teachers, and my peers. This feedback allowed me to view my work from a different perspective and helped me identify what was working and what was not. For example, I asked some of my teachers who specialize in design for feedback on some of the designs.

            The feedback I received was positive as many liked my very stylized approach to the design. 

            <br><br>Although the design worked visually, it was brought to my attention that logically, the direction of the trumpet did not make sense. If a person were to play the trumpet in my drawing, the sound would travel in the wrong direction.
            <br><br>With this feedback, I decided to think of ways that would make sense logically and visually.

    <h3>Final Adjustments</h3>

        <div class="textbox">
            I then created trumpet-inspired logo designs that resembled the instrument more realistically while still having the same stylized elements as my previous designs.<br><br> I then decided to get feedback from the client to see if this design resonated with them.
            The feedback I received was positive and that they found the first design to resonate with them as a company the most.<br><br>The only change they requested was for the trumpet to be a brighter yellow colour instead of the beige colour it was currently.
