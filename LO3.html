        <h2>1st Project – Rebranding (Logo Design) </h2>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Logo design is something I find very <b>challenging but really enjoy</b>. For the rebranding project for “Geldrops MuziekCorps,” we were required to design a new logo that was <b>modern but also resonated with the client</b>. As shown in the illustrations below, the designing process was somewhat chaotic, with us playing around with any idea that came to mind.

        </section>
        <h3>Initial Challenges and Learning</h3>
        <p>
            Before working on this project, I had <b>no experience using Illustrator</b>, so it was quite challenging initially. I started by tracing some images of instruments to help familiarize myself with the program. I also attended an Illustrator Introduction workshop, which helped me navigate the program and understand the basics.
        </p>
        <h3>Iteration and Design Process</h3>
        <p>
            I learned the <b>importance of iterating</b> and always duplicating the design before adding to it. This practice allows you to see how the design has evolved and to have something to refer back to in case of errors. Throughout my design process, iteration is visible, with each design differing slightly from the previous one.
        </p>
        <h3>Feedback and Refinement</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout the design process, I received <b>helpful feedback from the client, my teachers, and my peers</b>. This feedback allowed me to view my work from a <b>different perspective</b> and helped me identify what was working and what was not. For example, I asked some of my teachers who specialize in design for feedback on some of the designs.
        </p>
        <section class="LO-box">
            <img src="GMCLOGO1.jpg">
            <div class="textbox">
                The feedback I received was positive as many liked my very stylized approach to the design. 

                <br><br>Although the design worked visually, it was brought to my attention that logically, the direction of the trumpet did not make sense. If a person were to play the trumpet in my drawing, the sound would travel in the wrong direction.
                <br><br>With this feedback, I decided to think of ways that would make sense logically and visually.

            <div class="textbox">
                I then created trumpet-inspired logo designs that resembled the instrument more realistically while still having the same stylized elements as my previous designs.<br><br> I then decided to get feedback from the client to see if this design resonated with them.
                The feedback I received was positive and that they found the first design to resonate with them as a company the most.<br><br>The only change they requested was for the trumpet to be a brighter yellow colour instead of the beige colour it was currently.

        <h2>SPRINT X (INTERACTIVE TO-DO LIST DESIGN)</h2>
        <p>
            After conducting in-depth research into User Experience Design and User Preferences for To-Do List applications 
            (read more in Learning Outcome 4), I began my design process by drawing up some basic <b>wireframes</b> for possible 
            layouts. A key takeaway from my research was that users have different preferences for layouts, with some preferring
            tasks organized as a list, some preferring a Calander layout and others preferring the “post-it” note, analogue style. 
            With this aspect in mind, I decided to create the option for the user to rearrange their tasks in <b>different layouts, 
            in order to find one which would best suit their preferences</b>.</p>
        <section class="LO-box">
            <img src="wireframe sprint x.png" style="max-width: 30%;">
            <div class="textbox">
                In my wireframe, I came up with a few ideas for how I could arrange these different layouts, inspired by other 
                applications such as Miro and Asana.<br><br> Once I had drawn my wireframes, I showed them to my fellow students in order 
                to get their input on the layout. The feedback they gave me was positive, and that they liked the option to change 
                the layout to their preference.
            </div>
        </section>
        <p>The next step I took was creating some <b>low fidelity prototypes</b> in Figma, all super simple with no colour to get a general 
            idea of the layout. After creating these, I conducted some user testing which you can read more about in Learning Outcome 1.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="lowfed sprintx 1.png" style="max-width: 40%;">
            <img src="lowfed sprintx 2.png" style="max-width: 40%;">
        </div>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="lowfed sprintx 3.png"style="max-width: 40%; margin-left: 50px ;">
            <div class="textbox">
                The feedback that I got from those who participated in the user tests was positive. The design flaws that were brought up were that the use ‘star icon’ (meant to be a way to favourite or prioritize a task) on the list layout was not clear. They suggested that I either make it another icon such as a ‘pin’ icon or that I make it bigger or a bright colour. They also felt that the tasks should be listed in date order (soonest – furthest).
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Next, I created a <b>High Fedelity Prototype</b> in Figma and formulated a colour pallette to compliment my design and layout.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ColourPallette.png">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>#9FAAA6 (Soft Grayish Green):<br>This color conveys a sense of calmness, stability, and neutrality. It's soothing and grounding, often associated with nature and tranquility. </li><br>
            <li>#0F1525 (Dark Blue):<br>This deep, dark blue gives a feeling of sophistication and depth. It can be associated with seriousness, elegance, and a touch of mystery.</li><br>
            <li>#FFFBFA (Soft Off-White):<br>This gentle, almost white color brings a sense of purity, simplicity, and cleanliness. It’s fresh and unobtrusive, offering a clean and open feeling.</li><br>
            <li>#E8F3EB (Light Mint Green):<br>This light mint green is refreshing and calming. It suggests renewal, serenity, and a connection to nature, contributing to a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere.</li><br>
            <li>#FFEFD8 (Light Peach):<br>This light peach color gives off warmth and softness. It’s comforting and gentle, evoking feelings of warmth, coziness, and friendliness.</li><br>
            <li>#C8E3FF (Light Sky Blue):<br> This light sky blue is calm and serene. It’s reminiscent of clear skies and open spaces, giving a feeling of freedom, tranquility, and a touch of optimism.</li><br>

        </ul>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="PrototypesSprintX.png" style="max-width: 80%;">
        </div>
        <p>In the first row of prototypes, I use the main colour for each layout as the background colour. Initially I thought this was a good idea as it helps identify which section the user is in clearly. However, after feedback some users brought to my attention that they prefer a <b>white background to resemble paper</b> as this helps make the tasks more clear. So, my second attempt after hearing the feedback can be seen below.</p>
        <p>Whilst developing, I ran into a few issues with getting the functionality to work with this layout. It is for these reasons that whilst developing I <b>slightly altered the design</b>. I believe that this was for the better as u actually prefer the design that I came up with while building this application. As seen in the screenshot below, I decided to make the layout buttons look like <b>‘tabs” in a file</b>. I believe that this adds and analogue to-do list feel and is more unique compared to other designs I have seen.</p>

        <h2>Portfolio Design</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Designing my portfolio definitely was the <b>highlight of my semester</b>. I have a very big passion for design and I use building my portfolio as my main creative outlet. Due to the excitement around this project, I was flooded with ideas and so I battled to settle on a design choice.
            <br><br>
            I began my design process the <b>incorrect way</b> initially, and I went <b>straight into figma</b> to play aroud with ideas that came to mind. Although this should not be the first step, I let my excitement get the best of me and so I dove right in. The images below are the initial designs that I came up with: 
        </p>
        <div class="carousel-container first-carousel">
            <div class="carousel">
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="Wireframe-portfolio3.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 1"></div>
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="Wireframe-portfolio4.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 2"></div>
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="Wireframe-portfolio5.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 3"></div>
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="Wireframe-portfolio6.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 4"></div>
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="Wireframe-portfolio1.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 5"></div>
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="Wireframe-portfolio2.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 6"></div>
            </div>
            <button class="carousel-button prev first-prev">&lt;</button>
            <button class="carousel-button next first-next">&gt;</button>
        </div>
        <p>After creating these designs, I decided that I <b>did not like any of them</b> and that they 
            felt too generic and they did not have the personal touch that I wanted to include in 
            my portfolio. So, I decided to start again but this time, I started the correct way 
            by conducting some research and creating a <b>style scale</b> in Photoshop, to create a general
            ‘Mood Board” of the vibe I wanted to show in my design.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="StyleScapePortfolio.jpg">

        <div class="dropdown">
            <div class="dropdown-header">
                <span>Next, I went to pen and paper and drew out some <b>wireframes</b> to play around with various layouts</span>
                <span class="toggle-button">+</span>
            </div>
            <div class="dropdown-content">

        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>The inspiration behind my deisgn</h3>
        <p>
            My design work is always heavily <b>influenced by the media I am consuming</b> and I often take inspiration from other artists who I interact with. During the creation of this portfolio and over the semester, I was mainly listening to one of my favorite electronic artists, Aphex Twin, as I find this music to help me with concentration and increase my productivity. I looked at various album art and posters as well the information spreads which you receive when purchasing a CD or Vinyl for inspiration. The ‘Aphex Twin style’ has a very particular, simplistic look which I find to be really visually appealing but unique at the same time. 
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Syro TypeFace.jpeg" style="max-width: 50%;">
        </div>
        <p>The album ‘Syro’ really caught my attention in particular due to its bright, unique colour. This colour is one that I have been seeing more of in the design world recently with similar ‘lemon-lime’ hues being featured on lists of colour trends in Graphic Deisgn for 2024. Another aspect which I discovered was that the HEX code for this colour is actually #BADA55 which I thought was a funny and clever easter egg.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ColourInspo.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>Although I really loved this <b>bright, unique colour</b> as the main background of my website, I received some mixed feedback. Some of my peers and teachers appreciated it for its uniqueness and eye-catching quality. However, others pointed out that such a bright colour might <b>not be ideal since pictures placed on top of it could clash</b>. Despite this valid concern, I was still determined to keep the bright colour. To address potential issues with colour clashing, I <b>explored ways to adjust my design and structure the layout more effectively</b>.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="WhiteSectionSS.png">
        </div>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="containerimage.png" style="max-width: 50%;">
            <img src="containerimage2.png" style=" max-width: 50%;">
        </div>
        <p>In the images above, you can that I first tried to simply add a white background to certain sections to <b>help reduce the colour clashing</b> and to make the images 'pop-out' more. However, I felt that this was too harsh of a contrast and so I decided to rather lower the opacity and add some padding aswell as a border radius to soften it up. As you can see by the examples above, the colour clashing between the image and the background is significantly reduced. For images with more neutral colours, I left them directly on the background without any additional changes.</p>
        <p>
            I also had a lot of images to serve as evidence for learning outcomes such as project plans, screen shots of feedback and wireframes which are not necessarily the “prettiest” images and do not fit in with the overall aesthetic of my design, so for these images I implemented a <b>“drop-down” feature</b>. This allows the evidence to be seen when it is needed, but for it to disappear but it is not required.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the Stylescape and wireframes, I began working on a Figma Prototype to figure out how I wanted my layout to look. For more information about this prototype,

        </p>
        <h3>Logo Creation</h3>
        <p>
            In regards to my logo designs, I knew I wanted to make something <b>eye catching</b> that would cover my home page but also would work as a “home button” on all of my pages. I started by design process by drawing some ideas on paper and then I took to illustrator to play around with different effects and fonts.  
        </p>
        <div class="carousel-container second-carousel">
            <div class="carousel">
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="milalogo4.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 1"></div>
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="milalogo2.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 2"></div>
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="milalogo3.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 3"></div>
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="paperwireframe2.jpg" alt="Portfolio Iteration 4"></div>
            </div>
            <button class="carousel-button prev second-prev">&lt;</button>
            <button class="carousel-button next second-next">&gt;</button>
        </div>
        <p>
            I then decided to choose a chrome inspired style for my logos as it is a design trend I have been seeing a lot of recently and so I thought I would try it for myself. I <b>first tried to create it on illustrator</b> with the inflate effect but as seen in the image below, it did not work out. 
        </p>
        <div class="carousel-container third-carousel">
            <div class="carousel">
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="inflate1.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 1"></div>
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="inflate2.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 2"></div>
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="inflate4.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 3"></div>
                <div class="carousel-item"><img src="inflate3.png" alt="Portfolio Iteration 4"></div>
            </div>
            <button class="carousel-button prev third-prev">&lt;</button>
            <button class="carousel-button next third-next">&gt;</button>
        </div>
        <p>
            I then chatted to my father and brother who both have some basic experience in Photoshop, and they <b>suggested to me that I switch to creating my logo in Photoshop</b> if I want to create the metal effect. So, I took their advise and began to play around with different effects until I found one which I liked. Once I had chosen my effect, I tried it out with different fonts as well as different versions of my name to see what looked best. I then decided on going with KELSI 1 FILL which is a bubble, graffiti style font which I think matched the style of the portfolio design well.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then decided on creating two logos. One that just said “MILA” for the main element of my index page, and the other one a circle with “M” inside, heavily inspired by the Aphex Twin logo, to be used as a “Home Button”.
        </p>
