        <h1>Development & Version Control</h1>
        <h2>Git (Version Control)</h2>
        <h3>What I Did:</h3>
        <p>
            Embracing the principles of version control, I have utilized platforms like Git to manage and track changes effectively throughout the development process.
            <br><br>
            At the beginning of the semester, I had a lot of confusion and concern about Git, as I didn’t quite understand what it was. I constantly heard the term mentioned, but I avoided it, thinking it would be a difficult concept to grasp. After getting help from peers who were further along in their studies, I finally understood what Git was and how helpful it is.
            <br><br>
            After encountering many problems while using HERA to host my previous portfolio, I researched other ways to host websites and learned that I could host on GitHub. I found the entire process to be much simpler than HERA, and I have encountered no problems so far.
            <br><br>
            Since I am using GitHub for hosting, I had to transfer my repository to GitLab to make it accessible to my teachers aswell as set up Automatic Mirroring so that all changes to my Github repository would update in my GitLab repository automatically.  I also set up my GitLab account for group projects, as we used GitLab to collaborate on the same code.

        <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
        <p>
            Through using Git, I have learned many important and crucial skills that will benefit me greatly in the years to come. These skills include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>COMMIT MESSAGING: Writing clear, concise, and standardized commit messages.</li>
            <li>BRANCHING AND MERGING: Managing branches and resolving conflicts efficiently.</li>
            <li>COLLABORATION: Using pull requests, conducting code reviews, linking commits to issues.</li>
            <li>WORKFLOWS: Implementing Gitflow, feature branching, trunk-based development.</li>
                
        </ul>
        <h2>3rd Project - Development</h2>
        <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
        <p>For our final group project of the semester, my team and I focused on improving the Fontys ICT website. Our primary objectives were to attract new students through making a more user-friendly design and to raise awareness of important information such as the different profiles within the ICT course. After creating an interactive prototype and conducting user testing, we divided the webpages into sections for individual contributions.</p>
        <h3>What I did:</h3>
        <p>I was responsible for the bottom half of the Home Page. My tasks included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CREATING DROP-DOWN SECTIONS: I implemented interactive drop-down sections to provide additional information about admission requirements.</li>
            <li>DEVELOPING A CONTACT FORM: I designed and coded a functional contact form to facilitate communication between prospective students and the institution.</li>
            <li>BUILDING THE REST OF THE PAGE: Using HTML and CSS to bring the design to life</li>
            <p>To create the drop-down information sections, I used JavaScript. Here’s a snippet of the code I wrote:</p>
            <section class="image-container">
                <figure>
                        <img src="DevSSpro3.png">
                        <figcaption>FIGURE A</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </section>
            <p>EXPLANATION:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>DOMContentLoaded Event:<br>Ensures the script runs only after the DOM is fully loaded, preventing errors related to unavailable elements.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Selecting Elements:<br>Uses document.querySelectorAll to target all .requirement-box elements, allowing the script to handle multiple drop-down sections.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Looping through Each Box:<br>The forEach method is used to iterate through each .requirement-box element, selecting the relevant .header, .content, and .toggle-button elements within each box.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Adding Click Event Listener:<br>Attaches a click event listener to the header of each box. When clicked, it toggles the visibility of the content and updates the toggle button's text accordingly.</li>
                <p>This approach provides a simple and effective way to create expandable and collapsible sections on a webpage, enhancing the user experience by allowing users to control the visibility of additional information.</p>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Brief reflection on past Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
            In regards to Development, this semester I have focused on improving my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Coding is something which I actually really enjoy and often find exciting, however I tend to make a lot of mistakes and I often struggle to grasp concepts as fast as I would like to, which can leave me feeling less motivated and discouraged.
        </p>
        <p>To start the semester, I did a lot of reflecting on my previous Portfolio from semester one and focused on the problems that it had in order to fix them going forward. Figure B below shows a small snippet of CSS code from my old portfolio where many examples of the mistakes I made are evident. These mistakes include:

        </p>
        <section class="image-container">
            <figure>
                    <img src="OLDCODESS.png">
                    <figcaption>FIGURE B</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </section>
        <ul>
            <li>REPITITION: The font family has been declared many times which is unnecessary and can be easily avoided by defining a global font family.</li>
            <li>MAGIC NUMBERS: The code uses hardcoded values for widths, height and font size which can make maintenance and stability a challenge. </li>
            <li>LACK OF CONCISENCY: The code uses different units for fonts (px) and widths/heights (px and %). Its better practice to just use one unit of measurement throughout the code.</li>
            <li>INCOMPLETE SELECTORS: &#39;H3&#39; and &#39;H6&#39; selectors are not specific to any class or ID which can result in unintended styling. Using a class and ID can help target specific design elements.</li>
            <li>NO COMMENTS: Not commenting code is a bad practice as it will make it harder for developers to maintain, collaborate and understand my code. </li>
            <li>CLASS NAMES: Another problem with my code which I picked up on by getting feedback from some other students was that my class names were often confusing and too lengthy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is very important to fix simple mistakes like these as they can lead to bad habits which will affect me later on, especially when collaborating with other people as they will face difficulties interpreting my code. With these aspects in mind, I began my developing process for my portfolio. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Sematic HTML</h2>
        <h3>What I Did</h3>
        <p>
            Attending Metaxas' lectures taught me the importance of using semantic HTML. During this semester, I made a conscious effort to use semantic tags instead of defaulting to &ltdiv&gt; or &ltspan&gt;, which I often use due to ingrained coding habits. For instance, I used the &ltsection&gt; tag to organize my page into distinct sections, which allowed me to change the background color of specific areas.
        </p>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
            I learned that semantic HTML is crucial for creating web content that is accessible, maintainable, and SEO-friendly. This awareness has highlighted the importance of using appropriate HTML tags rather than relying on non-semantic ones.
        </p>
        <h3>How I think it went</h3>
        <p>
            Reflecting on my progress, I recognize that in future projects, I need to focus more on reducing my reliance on the &ltdiv&gt; tag. Despite my efforts, I still use it too frequently. Although it feels almost like muscle memory to reach for a &ltdiv&gt; tag, I am determined to continue improving and fully adopt the use of semantic HTML. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Banner and Slideshow</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted to create something eye catching and exciting in my portfolio that added a unique touch. After brainstorming ideas, I was inspired to create a banner which displays a moving text effect with a smooth, infinite, scrolling animation. The banner sits at the top of each page and displays the name of the page that the user is currently on. To create this effect, I made use of CSS styles and animations. I experimented with various CSS properties to ensure the scrolling effect was smooth and visually appealing. Additionally, I had to consider the performance impact of continuous animations and optimized the code to minimize any potential lag.
        </p>
        <p>
            The banner not only enhances the user experience by providing a dynamic visual element but also shows my ability to implement CSS animations. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate more interactive and engaging elements into my portfolio.
        </p>
        <div class="banner">
            <p> THIS IS THE BANNER I MADE! THIS IS THE BANNER I MADE! THIS IS THE BANNER I MADE!  </p>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Magic 8 Ball</h2>
        <p>
            To practice my JavaScript skills, I decided to challenge myself with some fun personal projects. I started by creating a Magic 8 Ball that generates a random answer when clicked. The reason I chose this project is because I often use a Magic 8 Ball app for fun, making it an area of personal interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            To begin, I watched a tutorial to get a general idea of how to create it, then I developed my own version with a few tweaks to make it unique. The project involved learning how to generate random responses and update the display dynamically using JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although it is a simple project, it effectively helped me practice and improve my JavaScript skills. I learned how to handle user interactions, manipulate the DOM, and implement basic logic in a web application. Reflecting on the experience, I feel more confident in my ability to take on more complex projects in the future. This small but meaningful exercise has motivated me to continue exploring and creating with JavaScript.
