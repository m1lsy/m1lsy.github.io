        <h1>Development & Version Control</h1>
    <p>In regards to the Development and Version Control, I have engaged in a comprehensive exploration of web development tools and practices. Through hands-on experience, I have drasricly improved my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to create a dynamic and visually appealing portfolio website. I have also worked on these skills through creating personal projects, to help familiarize myself with new concepts that I have learnt in workshops. </p>

        <p>Embracing the principles of version control, I have utilized platforms like Git to manage and track changes effectively throughout the development process. By actively collaborating with peers, receiving feedback, and iteratively refining my work, I demonstrated a proficient understanding of development methodologies and version control techniques, ensuring the successful attainment of this learning outcome.
