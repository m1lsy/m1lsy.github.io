        <h1>Development & Version Control</h1>
    <p>In regard to development, this semester I have built my skills in HTML, CSS as well as JavaScript. Through working on group projects, attending workshops and doing ways to do things. An example of where I have used all three of these programming languages is in the creation of my Portfolio. </p>

        <ul>-REPITITION: The font family has been declared many times which is unnecessary and can be easily avoided by defining a global font family.</ul>
    <ul>-MAGIC NUMBERS: The code uses hardcoded values for widths, height and font size which can make maintenance and stability a challenge. </ul>
    <ul>-LACK OF CONCISENCY: The code uses different units for fonts (px) and widths/heights (px and %). Its better practice to just use one unit of measurement throughout the code.</ul>
    <ul>-INCOMPLETE SELECTORS: &#39;H3&#39; and &#39;H6&#39; selectors are not specific to any class or ID which can result in unintended styling. Using a class and ID can help target specific design elements.</ul>
    <ul>-NO COMMENTS: Not commenting code is a bad practice as it will make it harder for developers to maintain, collaborate and understand my code. </ul>
    <ul>-CLASS NAMES: Another problem with my code which I picked up on by getting feedback from some other students was that my class names were often confusing and too lengthy.</ul>
