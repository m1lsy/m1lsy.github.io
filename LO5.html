        <h1>PERSONAL LEADERSHIP</h1>
        <h2>CORE VALUES</h2>
        <p>During the semester, I attended one of Anke’s workshops where we discussed the importance of defining our core values. 
            Defining our core values as individuals is essential for <b>helping us shape our behaviour, decisions, and overall approach 
            to life</b>. After discussing this topic with my family and friends and giving it some thought, I developed a list of five 
            core values that I believe best represent me and my beliefs.</p>
        <h3>Ambition</h3>
        <p>Throughout the semester, I was driven by ambition to <b>set high standards for myself</b> and achieve my goals. With ambition, 
            I improved aspects such as attendance and time management, consistently pushing myself to excel in all of my work and be on time for lectures.</p>
        <h3>Adaptability</h3>
        <p>Over the past few months, I encountered many situations requiring adaptability. One example is <b>adapting my working style </b>
            when collaborating on team projects. Everyone has their preferences and ways of working, and I learned to be flexible to
             accommodate others' needs. Additionally, this semester was my first time balancing a <b>part-time job with my studies</b>, which 
            required me to adapt to a changing work schedule. This sometimes made meeting deadlines challenging, as I often did not 
            know when I would be free to do schoolwork. This also made getting to school on time diffcult as I noramlly finish work in the early hours of the morning, but despite this I managed to get to class on time. I also demonstrated adaptability by finding my own solution to hosting my 
            website on GitHub when Hera did not work for me properly.</p>
        <h3>Creativity </h3>
        <p>I consistently applied creativity to my projects and assignments, coming up with innovative solutions and unique approaches
            to all of my projects. This not only enhanced the quality of my work but also made the process more enjoyable and fulfilling. I beleive a good example of my creativity can be seen throughout my portfolio as the design is unique and I put a lot of time into it. To see the entire process of this design, please see <a href="LO3.html">Learning Outcome 3.</a></p>
        <h3>Openness</h3>
        <p>I showed openness by being <b>receptive to new ideas and feedback from others</b>. Engaging in discussions with classmates and instructors 
            helped me broaden my understanding and get inspiration for new ideas I would not have thought up myself. I feel that my openness has drastically improved this semster and that I have been making a concerted effort to seek the opinions of others in order to improve myself.</p>
        <h3>Enthusiasm</h3>
        <p>My enthusiasm was evident in my <b>proactive participation in class and good attendance</b>. This positive attitude 
            kept me motivated and excited about my projects. This can be seen through my determination to improve by seeking feedback, discussions about my passions for certain topics such as design (read more in <a href="LO3.html">Learning Outcome 3</a> ) and by "going the extra mile" and teaching myself new skills and concepts which I discuss below.         </p>
        <h2>LEARNING NEW SKILLS INDEPENDENTLY</h2>
        <h3>What I Did:</h3>
        <p>
            I showed my personal leadership and my <b>commitment to learning</b> through out the semester by going the extra mile and teaching myself new skills. These skills include learning new programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop and Blender. 
            <br><br>
            ILLUSTRATOR
            <br>
            Before beginning this semester, I had <b>no experience with illustrator and blender and some very beginner level skills in photoshop</b>. Design is something that has always been appealing to me and something that I am passionate about and so I was very excited to begin the process of exploring these new programs.
            <br><br>
            I learnt the basics of Illustrator by watching <b>YouTube tutorials</b> to help me navigate my way around the program. I also attended a <b>workshop taught by Jan</b> where he gave a beginners crash course to the program. With this basic knowledge, I was able to complete my first logo design for Geldrops MuziekCorps in the first rebranding project. To further practice my Illustrator skills, I also tried to do some logo design options for my friends nail bsuiness.

            PHOTOSHOP
            <br>
            In regards to Photoshop, I have had some previous experience in High School playing around with it for fun projects but no serious experience. As with Illustrator, I watched a few youtube tutorials and I also asked my father for help as he has some experience with it. I was quiet pleased with my progress in Photoshop as I managed to make my logos with this programme and I was pleased with the outcome of them.

            BLENDER
            <br>
            I was extremely excited to begin my journey with 3D modelling this semester in Blender as it is something that has always <b>fascinated me</b>. My excitement got the best of me and I started playing around with it before my first lecture and <b>tried to follow the famous donut tutorial by Blender Guru</b>. Unfortunately, I gave up due to the program constantly crashing as soon as I tried to edit my shape. I was then very exciting when Jan started hosting Blender workshops as this allowed me to start from the very beginning with projects that were more at a beginner level. Below is a kitchen model which I made in a workshop.

            RONIN GIMBAL
            <br>
            I also learnt how to use a Ronin Gimbal through experimenting with it for my second group project. Together as a team, we got it from the ISSD and set it up and played around with it. It was <b>quite complex and very new to me</b>, but it was very exciting to play around with a new device like this. We managed to produce a short video as a Proof of Concept for our Media Campaign.

        <h3>What I learned:</h3>
        <p>
            Through these various processes, I learnt how to navigate new programs and learnt the basic skills of each one. I also learnt how to use new equipment which also taught me to use the ISSD more as there are so many amazing devices and pieces of equipment for us to use and so in future, I should really make use of the ISSD.
        </p>
        <h2>Improving Workflow</h2>
        <p>
            This semester, I put a large part of my focus on improving my workflow. Typically, I am a very <b>disorganized person</b> and I often struggle to meet deadlines. I have tried various techniques in the past to improve my organization and time management such as using <b>productivity applications</b> like Notion or even tasks as simple as making a “To-Do List”, but I have realized that these things do not work for me and often just end up being a waste of time.
            <br><br>
            I also prefer to just <b>‘dive into’ my work straight away</b> and often find the process of planning and prototyping to be annoying. For example, I tend to start working on the final product and designing as I go rather than created a definite plan first. Although this is how I like to work, I have encounted many issues through working this way and so I knew I needed to change it. 
        </p>
        <h3>What I did:</h3>
        <p>
            To stay on top of things, I decided to start working on my portfolio in the very beginning of the semester to ensure that I was not left with a lot of last minute work. I also ensured to keep my attendance high and to make use of OIL time aswell as attend lectures. I also starting creating wireframes and prototyping before beginning my final projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also decided to try and <b>make my own To-Do List application
            </b> for Sprint X, in order to help me improve my organization. This allowed me to build a custom application that suited my needs and preferences and is something I can use going forward.
        </p>
        <h3>What i learned:</h3>
        <p>
            Through trying to change my work flow, I learnt the importance of consistency and that in order to change these habits I had to put in work every day. I also learnt that you should not “make things up as you go” as this often results in more work in the end. 
        </p>
        <h3>How I think it went:</h3>
        <p>
            I deficiently noticed an <b>improvement in my workflow</b> this semester compared to last semester as I felt way more organized and focused. I am no where near where I want to be but I believe that if I practice these good habits going forward I can drastically continue to improve in the future
