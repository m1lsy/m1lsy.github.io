        <h1>PERSONAL LEADERSHIP</h1>
        <h2>CORE VALUES</h2>
        <p>During the semester, I attended one of Anke’s workshops where we discussed the importance of defining our core values. 
            Defining our core values as individuals is essential for helping us shape our behaviour, decisions, and overall approach 
            to life. After discussing this topic with my family and friends and giving it some thought, I developed a list of five 
            core values that I believe best represent me and my beliefs.</p>
        <h3>Ambition</h3>
        <p>Throughout the semester, I was driven by ambition to set high standards for myself and achieve my goals. With ambition, 
            I improved aspects such as attendance and time management, consistently pushing myself to excel in all of my work.</p>
        <h3>Adaptability</h3>
        <p>Over the past few months, I encountered many situations requiring adaptability. One example is adapting my working style 
            when collaborating on team projects. Everyone has their preferences and ways of working, and I learned to be flexible to
             accommodate others' needs. Additionally, this semester was my first time balancing a part-time job with my studies, which 
            required me to adapt to a changing work schedule. This sometimes made meeting deadlines challenging, as I often did not 
            know when I would be free to do schoolwork. I also demonstrated adaptability by finding my own solution to hosting my 
            website on GitHub when Hera did not work for me properly.</p>
        <h3>Creativity </h3>
        <p>I consistently applied creativity to my projects and assignments, coming up with innovative solutions and unique approaches
            to all of my projects. This not only enhanced the quality of my work but also made the process more enjoyable and fulfilling.</p>
        <h3>Openness</h3>
        <p>I showed openness by being receptive to new ideas and perspectives. Engaging in discussions with classmates and instructors 
            helped me broaden my understanding and get inspiration for new ideas I would not have though up myself.</p>
        <h3>Enthusiasm</h3>
        <p>My enthusiasm was evident in my proactive participation in class and good attendance. This positive attitude 
            kept me motivated and excited about my projects.         </p>
        <h2>LEARNING NEW SKILLS INDEPENDENTLY</h2>
        <h3>What I Did:</h3>
        <p>
            I showed my personal leadership and my commitment to learning through out the semester by going the extra mile and teaching myself new skills. These skills include learning new programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop and Blender. 
            <br><br>
            ILLUSTRATOR
            <br>
            Before beginning this semester, I had no experience with illustrator and blender and some very beginner level skills in photoshop. Design is something that has always been appealing to me and something that I am passionate about and so I was very excited to begin the process of exploring these new programs.
            <br><br>
            I learnt the basics of Illustrator by watching YouTube tutorials to help me navigate my way around the program. I also attended a workshop taught by Jan where he gave a beginners crash course to the program. With this basic knowledge, I was able to complete my first logo design for Geldrops MuziekCorps in the first rebranding project. To further practice my Illustrator skills, I also tried to do some logo design options for my friends nail bsuiness.

            </section>
            <br><br>
            PHOTOSHOP
            <br>
            In regards to Photoshop, I have had some previous experience in High School playing around with it for fun projects but no serious experience. As with Illustrator, I watched a few youtube tutorials and I also asked my father for help as he has some experience with it. 
            <br><br>
            BLENDER
            <br>
            I was extremely excited to begin my journey with 3D modelling this semester in Blender as it is something that has always fascinated me. My excitement got the best of me and I started playing around with it before my first lecture and tried to follow the famous donut tutorial by Blender Guru. Unfortunately, I gave up due to the program constantly crashing as soon as I tried to edit my shape. I was then very exciting when Jan started hosting Blender workshops as this allowed me to start from the very beginning with projects that were more at a beginner level. Below is a kitchen model which I made in a workshop.

            <br><br>
            RONIN GIMBAL
            <br>
            I also learnt how to use a Ronin Gimbal through experimenting with it for my second group project. Together as a team, we got it from the ISSD and set it up and played around with it. It was quite complex and very new to me, but it was very exciting to play around with a new device like this.

        <h3>What I learned:</h3>
        <p>
            Through these various processes, I learnt how to navigate new programs and learnt the basic skills of each one. I also learnt how to use new equipment which also taught me to use the ISSD more as there are so many amazing devices and pieces of equipment for us to use. 
        </p>
        <h2>Improving Workflow</h2>
        <p>
            This semester, I put a large part of my focus on improving my workflow. Typically, I am a very disorganized person and I often struggle to meet deadlines. I have tried various techniques in the past to improve my organization and time management such as using productivity applications like Notion or even tasks as simple as making a “To-Do List”, but I have realized that these things do not work for me and often just end up being a waste of time.
            <br><br>
            I also prefer to just ‘dive into’ my work straight away and often find the process of planning and prototyping to be annoying. For example, I tend to start working on the final product and designing as I go rather than created a definite plan first. Although this is how I like to work, I have encounted many issues through working this way and so I knew I needed to change it. 
        </p>
        <h3>What I did:</h3>
        <p>
            To stay on top of things, I decided to start working on my portfolio in the very beginning of the semester to ensure that I was not left with a lot of last minute work. I also ensured to keep my attendance high and to make use of OIL time aswell as attend lectures. I also starting creating wireframes and prototyping before beginning my final projects.
        </p>
        <h3>What i learned:</h3>
        <p>
            Through trying to change my work flow, I learnt the importance of consistency and that in order to change these habits I had to put in work every day. I also learnt that you should not “make things up as you go” as this often results in more work in the end. 
        </p>
        <h3>How I think it went:</h3>
        <p>
            I deficiently noticed an improvement in my workflow this semester compared to last semester as I felt more organized and focused. I am no where near where I want to be but I believe that if I practice these good habits going forward I can drastically continue to improve in the future
        </p>
        <h2>FUTURE PLANS & GOALS</h2>
        <p>
            As of right now, I have a couple ideas as to where I would like to do my internship aswell as what line of work I would like to go into. During my time living in Europe, I have done a lot of traveling as this is something I am very passionate about. One city which I keep going back to is Berlin. I absolutely fell in love with this city and though my travels, I have come to be quite familiar with it. It is because of this reason why I would like to look for an internship here and spend time living there. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to prepare myself for this, I have started doing German lessons on Duolingo. I have actually really surprised myself with my commitment with a streak of 63 days as of today. Learning German will benefit me drastically as even though berlin is a very international city with a lot of English speakers, speaking German will benefit me in everyday life and in the work place. 
        </p>

        <p>
            One of my mutual friends from South Africa recently moved to Berlin and has started her own Media Agency called Vhai Studios. I have been following her journey and so far, this seems like the type of work I can see myself in. Vhai are a future focused creative agency who do work with AR, Art Direction, Branding, Design, Management, Social Ads, Social Content, and Web Design. Based on their Instagram work and website, this is the type of job that aligns with my interests and passions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, Vhai Studios would be too small to do my internship at as they are just starting up and are not looking for interns, however I plan on doing further research into similar Berlin-Based agencies to find an internship that is similar.
