    As for the Personal Leadership learning outcome, I have demonstrated effective time management, communication, and leadership skills throughout the project. By taking ownership of tasks and coordinating with team members, I ensured timely completion of project milestones. Moreover, my proactive approach to seeking feedback and incorporating suggestions exemplifies my commitment to personal and professional growth.
