        <h1>PERSONAL LEADERSHIP</h1>
        <h2>LEARNING NEW SKILLS INDEPENDENTLY</h2>
        <h3>What I Did:</h3>
        <p>
            I showed my personal leadership and my commitment to learning through out the semester by going the extra mile and teaching myself new skills. These skills include learning new programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop and Blender. 
            <br><br>
            ILLUSTRATOR
            <br>
            Before beginning this semester, I had no experience with illustrator and blender and some very beginner level skills in photoshop. Design is something that has always been appealing to me and something that I am passionate about and so I was very excited to begin the process of exploring these new programs.
            <br><br>
            I learnt the basics of Illustrator by watching YouTube tutorials to help me navigate my way around the program. I also attended a workshop taught by Jan where he gave a beginners crash course to the program. With this basic knowledge, I was able to complete my first logo design for Geldrops MuziekCorps in the first rebranding project. 
            <br><br>
            PHOTOSHOP
            <br>
            In regards to Photoshop, I have had some previous experience in High School playing around with it for fun projects but no serious experience. As with Illustrator, I watched a few youtube tutorials and I also asked my father for help as he has some experience with it. 
            <br><br>
            BLENDER
            <br>
            I was extremely excited to begin my journey with 3D modelling this semester in Blender as it is something that has always fascinated me. My excitement got the best of me and I started playing around with it before my first lecture and tried to follow the famous donut tutorial by Blender Guru. Unfortunately, I gave up due to the program constantly crashing as soon as I tried to edit my shape. 
            <br><br>
            RONIN GIMBAL
            <br>
            I also learnt how to use a Ronin Gimbal through experimenting with it for my second group project. Together as a team, we got it from the ISSD and set it up and played around with it. It was quite complex and very new to me, but it was very exciting to play around with a new device like this.

        </section>
        <h3>What I learned:</h3>
        <p>
            Through these various processes, I learnt how to navigate new programs and learnt the basic skills of each one. I also learnt how to use new equipment which also taught me to use the ISSD more as there are so many amazing devices and pieces of equipment for us to use. 
        </p>
        <h2>Improving Workflow</h2>
        <p>
            This semester, I put a large part of my focus on improving my workflow. Typically, I am a very disorganized person and I often struggle to meet deadlines. I have tried various techniques in the past to improve my organization and time management such as using productivity applications like Notion or even tasks as simple as making a “To-Do List”, but I have realized that these things do not work for me and often just end up being a waste of time.
            <br><br>
            I also prefer to just ‘dive into’ my work straight away and often find the process of planning and prototyping to be annoying. For example, I tend to start working on the final product and designing as I go rather than created a definite plan first. Although this is how I like to work, I have encounted many issues through working this way and so I knew I needed to change it. 
        </p>
        <h3>What I did:</h3>
        <p>
            To stay on top of things, I decided to start working on my portfolio in the very beginning of the semester to ensure that I was not left with a lot of last minute work. I also ensured to keep my attendance high and to make use of OIL time aswell as attend lectures. I also starting creating wireframes and prototyping before beginning my final projects.
        </p>
        <h3>What i learned:</h3>
        <p>
            Through trying to change my work flow, I learnt the importance of consistency and that in order to change these habits I had to put in work every day. I also learnt that you should not “make things up as you go” as this often results in more work in the end. 
        </p>
        <h3>How I think it went:</h3>
        <p>
            I deficiently noticed an improvement in my workflow this semester compared to last semester as I felt more organized and focused. I am no where near where I want to be but I believe that if I practice these good habits going forward I can drastically continue to improve in the future
