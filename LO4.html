        <h2>PROJECT ORGINIZATION</h2>
        <p>
            Whilst working in groups, it is very important to form a solid foundation of rules and expectations 
            for each other from the very beginning of the project. This is important as while working with 
            people, it is common to run into problems as everyone has their own work ethics and their own 
            time schedules. Some group members may have jobs and be unable to meet whilst others may have 
            to leave the country for a few days, and so being organized is a very important factor.
        </p>
        <h3>WHAT I DID:</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure that my group did not run into any issues, I created a team charter to ensure we 
            all had similar expectations and clarity on what we each wanted for this project. Together 
            with my teammates, we also formulated a project plan which we would use to assign tasks to 
            each other and let each other know how close we were to completing the tasks.

        <p>As mentioned before, I am quite a disorganized person and I prefer to just ‘go with the 
            flow’ of things when doing my own work, instead of planning things out in advance. I 
            know that this is not a professional way of working and so I tried to combat these habits 
            by making an in-depth plan for my Sprint x project. </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>To reflect, this organization was very helpful as during my group projects I often ran 
            into issues where some members had to leave the country for a week or were unable to 
            complete a task, and this helped us stay on track and aided in communication. The 
            organization was also helpful in my personal work as it helped me stay on track with my 
            work and not fall behind. It also gave me a clear instruction as to what work I would be 
            working on. Although this is a new, unfamiliar way of working for me, I think it went 
            really well and I strive to keep implementing these organizational tactics in future.
        </p>

        <h2>COMMUNICATION WITH STEAKHOLDERS</h2>
        <p>
            For our first project, we started off the semester with a class trip to visit our clients 
            (Geldrops MuziekCorps) in Geldrop which is a neighboring town. I had never been to this 
            town so I was quite excited that we actually got to go somewhere instead of having the 
            clients come to us like the other classes. We got to chat with Marianne and Kees (who are 
            in charge of GMC) and hear their story aswell as their problems and goals for GMC. This 
            first hand interaction was very helpful as it helped us develop a relationship with our 
            client and was a good start to the semester.
        </p>
        <p>
            My group and I communicated with Marianne over email throughout the duration of the project 
            in order to give her updates aswell as ask her questions and get feedback on the work we had 
            done. In <a href="LO3.html">Learning Outcome 3</a>, I go in depth in the feedback I received from Marianne for my logo 
            design. 
        </p>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            We also met with Marianne and Kees in person twice more to present our progress and then 
            do a final presentation. Both presentations went well with both Marianne and Kees happy with 
            the outcome and final deliverables.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our second and third project, we had Neelsje from Marcom Fontys as our client. We met 
            with her on numerous occasions to get a briefing on the goals she had for the outcomes 
            aswell as to get feedback from her on various ideas and concepts. We also did four 
            presentations for her in order to show off what ideas we had and to show her our hard work.
        </p>
        <h2>1st Project - Rebranding (Conducting Research)</h2>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
            For my rebranding project for “Geldrops MuziekCorps,” I aimed to gather insights from the target audience to
            understand factors preventing them from joining the orchestra and their concerns. Additionally, I wanted to
            gather feedback on design elements such as color palettes and logo ideas to ensure the final design
            resonated with our audience.
        </p>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>
            To achieve these goals, I used the <b>Field Research Method</b> and I created two surveys to gain a deeper understanding of my target audiences preferences and habits:
        </p>
        <p>
            FIRST SURVEY:
        </p>
        <p>
            Research Question: "What are the key concerns and barriers preventing individuals from joining the "Geldrops
            MuziekCorps" orchestra?"
        </p>
        <p>
            This survey was aimed at the target audience of our project. It included detailed questions about their
            concerns and factors preventing them from joining the orchestra. Despite sending it to multiple people in
            the required demographic, I received only a handful of responses. When I enquired why people did not answer
            the survey, they mostly stated that they did not have time or did not want to answer in-depth questions.
            This feedback indicated that the questions were too long and required more time to answer than people were
            willing to spend.
        </p>
        <div class="survey-container">
            <img src="Survey Results GMC2.png">
            <img src="Survey GMC3.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            SECOND SURVEY:
        </p>
        <p>
            Research Question: "How do design preferences, such as color palettes and logo ideas, influence the
            perception and appeal of the "Geldrops MuziekCorps" rebranding among the target audience?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning from the first survey, I designed a shorter survey with five multiple-choice questions that
            included less text and more visual aspects. This survey focused on design elements such as possible color
            palettes and logo ideas.
        </p>
        <div class="survey-container">
            <img src="GMCSURVEY1.png">
            <img src="GMCSURVEY2.png">
        </div>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            The results from the first survey revealed that the factors preventing new members of the orchestra were cost of the membership and reputation of the orchestra. This told us to focus on advertising these two aspects when coming up with the design of the new GMC website. The second survey gave us clarity on what direction to go with our logo, with most people voting for a text based logo instead of an illustration. These results gave us great insights into the thought process of our target audiences preferences and thus was a great help in steering us in the right direction.

        <h2>2nd Project - Media Campaign (Interviews)</h2>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
            For our Media Campaign, my team and I made use of an amazing opportunity to conduct interviews (using the <b>Field Method</b>) with High School students who are interested in applying to ICT at Fontys. This was an amazing opportunity as they perfectly fit the demographic of our target audience. Our goals for the interviews was to receive some honest feedback on their experience with the ICT website and what they felt was lacking about it, in order to create a final product that addressed their concerns and satisfies their needs. 
        </p>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>
            Before thinking of questions to ask, we decided to formulate a research question: 
            <br><br>
            "How do potential students perceive the usability and content of the ICT website, and what improvements do they suggest to enhance their overall experience?"
            <br><br>
            Formulating this research question first is important as it aids in focus and direction throughout the methodology.
            <br><br>
            Once we had our research question, we began to formulate the questions for the interviews, ensuring to only make a few, short, easy to interpret questions to avoid the High School Students losing interest in the interview or declining to take part all together. 

            My teammates and I then went around the room and interviewed each student, making sure to jot down their answers and ideas. 

        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The results for these interviews were extremely helpful and gave us the first hand insight we required to move further in our project. Most of the students all had similar views on what they felt was laking from the Fontys website. To read more about the results, click the link to the PDF below:</p>
        <h2>Sprint X (Conducting Reseach)</h2>
        <h3>What I did</h3>
        <p>To begin the creation of my Interactive To-Do List application, I started with research to ensure I was designing an application that satisfied the needs and desires of my target audience. I began my research process with context mapping, utilizing the FIELD method. This involved conducting research on existing UX articles as well as creating and administering interviews and surveys. After collecting all of this information, I compiled my findings into a comprehensive research report.</p>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>From this research, I learned that understanding user needs and preferences is crucial for designing an effective interactive application. The insights gained from UX articles, interviews, and surveys highlighted key features and functionalities that users find valuable. Additionally, I discovered common pain points and areas for improvement in existing to-do list applications, which informed the design decisions for my project. </p>

        <h2>REPORTING</h2>
        <p>
            During this semester, I attended Anke’s lectures about the importance of professional 
            report writing and learned how to write professional user test reports and research reports. 
            These sessions helped teach me the correct structure that I should be following and how to 
            formulate effective research questions.
