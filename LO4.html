        <h2>1st Project - Rebranding (Conducting Research)</h2>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
            For my rebranding project for “Geldrops MuziekCorps,” I aimed to gather insights from the target audience to
            understand factors preventing them from joining the orchestra and their concerns. Additionally, I wanted to
            gather feedback on design elements such as color palettes and logo ideas to ensure the final design
            resonated with our audience.
        </p>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>
            To achieve these goals, I used the <b>Field Research Method</b> and I created two surveys to gain a deeper understanding of my target audiences preferences and habits:
        </p>
        <p>
            FIRST SURVEY:
        </p>
        <p>
            Research Question: "What are the key concerns and barriers preventing individuals from joining the "Geldrops
            MuziekCorps" orchestra?"
        </p>
        <p>
            This survey was aimed at the target audience of our project. It included detailed questions about their
            concerns and factors preventing them from joining the orchestra. Despite sending it to multiple people in
            the required demographic, I received only a handful of responses. When I enquired why people did not answer
            the survey, they mostly stated that they did not have time or did not want to answer in-depth questions.
            This feedback indicated that the questions were too long and required more time to answer than people were
            willing to spend.
        </p>
        <p>
            SECOND SURVEY:
        </p>
        <p>
            Research Question: "How do design preferences, such as color palettes and logo ideas, influence the
            perception and appeal of the "Geldrops MuziekCorps" rebranding among the target audience?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning from the first survey, I designed a shorter survey with five multiple-choice questions that
            included less text and more visual aspects. This survey focused on design elements such as possible color
            palettes and logo ideas.
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            The first survey received limited responses, which highlighted the need for shorter, more concise questions.
            The second survey, however, proved to be more successful, with 16 responses compared to the few responses
            from the first survey. This increased response rate provided valuable feedback from the target audience on
            design elements. The responses helped refine our design choices, ensuring the final product aligned with
            user preferences and enhanced the brand identity. Incorporating this feedback led to a more engaging and
            impactful website design that effectively communicated our brand message.

        <h2>2nd Project - Media Campaign (Interviews)</h2>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
            For our Media Campaign, my team and I made use of an amazing opportunity to conduct interviews (using the <b>Field Method</b>) with High School students who are interested in applying to ICT at Fontys. This was an amazing opportunity as they perfectly fit the demographic of our target audience. Our goals for the interviews was to receive some honest feedback on their experience with the ICT website and what they felt was lacking about it, in order to create a final product that addressed their concerns and satisfies their needs. 
        </p>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>
            Before thinking of questions to ask, we decided to formulate a research question: 
            <br><br>
            "How do potential students perceive the usability and content of the ICT website, and what improvements do they suggest to enhance their overall experience?"
            <br><br>
            Formulating this research question first is important as it aids in focus and direction throughout the methodology.
            <br><br>
            Once we had our research question, we began to formulate the questions for the interviews, ensuring to only make a few, short, easy to interpret questions to avoid the High School Students losing interest in the interview or declining to take part all together. 

            My teammates and I then went around the room and interviewed each student, making sure to jot down their answers and ideas. 

        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The results for these interviews were extremely helpful and gave us the first hand insight we required to move further in our project. Most of the students all had similar views on what they felt was laking from the Fontys website. To read more about the results, click the link to the PDF below:</p>
        <h2>organization</h2>
        <p>As mentioned before, I am quite a disorganized person and I prefer to just ‘go with the flow’ of things instead of planning things out in advance. I know that this is not a professional way of working and so I tried to combat these habits by making an in-depth plan for my Sprint x project. </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Although this is an unfamiliar and new way of working for me, it actually went quite well. Each day whilst working on this project, I would refer back to the timeline I made to see exactly what I needed to do for the day. This really helped me manage my time and ensured I was not falling behind. </p>
