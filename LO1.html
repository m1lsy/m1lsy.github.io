        <h2>2nd project â€“ Media Campaign (User Testing and Interactive Prototype)</h2>
        <p>For our second group project of the semester, we were tasked to create a Media Campaign to help the Fontys marketing team attract more students and to ensure that future students applying to Fontys ICT knew enough information about the course. Through research methods such as interviews and surveys, it was brought to our attention that the vast majority of students did not know about the various profile choices within the ICT study, and so we decided to focus on this aspect for our campaign as it plays a major role in the content that will be learnt during the study as well as the type of jobs you can go into in the future. 

            <br><br><br>To help create more awareness about the different profiles, our group thought of creating a study choice test to help students get a better idea as to which portfolio best matches their passions, skills and interests. This study choice test would consist of a few questions with multiple choice answers and will display the results of the best matched profiles as a percentage. 
            
           <br><br><br>We decided to create a prototype of this Study Choice Test in figma and asked High School students (who are our target audience) to take part in a user test and interact with our prototype aswell as give us Feedback on what they thought of the idea.
