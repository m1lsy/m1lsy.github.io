        <h2>2nd project – Media Campaign (User Testing and Interactive Prototype)</h2>
        <p>
            
For our second group project of the semester, we were tasked to create a Media Campaign to help the Fontys marketing team attract more students and to ensure that future students applying to Fontys ICT knew enough information about the course. Through research methods such as interviews and surveys, it was brought to our attention that the vast majority of students did not know about the various profile choices within the ICT study, and so we decided to focus on this aspect for our campaign as it plays a major role in the content that will be learnt during the study as well as the type of jobs you can go into in the future. 

<br><br><br>To help create more awareness about the different profiles, our group thought of creating a Study Choice Test to help students get a better idea as to which portfolio best matches their passions, skills and interests. This study choice test would consist of a few questions with multiple choice answers and will display the results of the best matched profiles to the individual as a percentage. 

<br><br><br>We decided to create a prototype of this Study Choice Test in Figma and asked High School students (who are our target audience) to take part in a user test and interact with our prototype aswell as give us Feedback on what they thought of the idea. The Interactive Prototype was mainly done by my team mates while I did the User Testing and the User Report.

<br><br><br>We watched the Users interact with the quiz and asked them various questions before and after the quiz to get a first hand understanding about their experience using the prototype. We also screen recorded their interaction to see what they were clicking and the movements of their curser. 

<br><br><br>With this helpful information, we were able to fix mistakes and tweak our prototype in order to create a fully functional final product with optimal success.

    <h2>3rd project – Development (User Testing & User Test Report)</h2>
    <p>In my third group project, we were tasked to revamp the Fontys ICT website and make it more effective in attracting more students. This project was related to our previous project (Media Campaign) and so most of the research had already been done and our ideas for this project were already brainstormed. 

        <br><br><br>So, we were able to dive right in with this new project and begin the design process immediately. Together with my teammate, we started by creating various wireframes and then finalizing a design and creating an interactive prototype for it. Once we had created our Interactive Prototype on Figma, we asked some of our peers to interact with our prototype and share their thoughts. User Testing is very important as it allows us as developers to see the work through a new set of eyes. During the User Test, we asked the User questions as well as sent up tasks in order to see if they could navigate the website.
        
        <br><br><br>After conducting the user testing on a few individuals, I wrote a user test report to serve as a documentation of findings, to use as a tool when communicating with stakeholders and to have a source of evidence to look back on when making major decisions. 
        
        <br><br><br>In conclusion, conducting these user tests aided me in ensuring that the design was aligned with the needs, preferences and behaviors of the user aswell as helps me identify issues such as confusing navigation and unclear call to action.
