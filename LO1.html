        <h2>2nd project – Media Campaign (User Testing and Interactive Prototype)</h2>
        <h3>What I did</h3>
        <p>
            For our second group project of the semester, we were tasked with creating a Media Campaign to help the Fontys marketing team attract more students and ensure that future students applying to Fontys ICT knew enough information about the course. Through research methods such as interviews and surveys, it was brought to our attention that the vast majority of students did not know about the various profile choices within the ICT study. We decided to focus on this aspect for our campaign as it plays a major role in the content that will be learned during the study as well as the type of jobs you can go into in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            To help create more awareness about the different profiles, our group thought of creating a Study Choice Test to help students get a better idea as to which portfolio best matches their passions, skills, and interests. This study choice test would consist of a few questions with multiple choice answers and will display the results of the best-matched profiles to the individual as a percentage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the <b>Workshop Method</b> from the DOT Framework, we decided to create a prototype of this Study Choice Test in Figma and asked High School students (who are our target audience) to take part in a user test and interact with our prototype as well as give us feedback on what they thought of the idea. The Interactive Prototype was mainly done by my teammates while I did the User Testing and the User Report. Usability Testings falls into the <b>Lab Method</b> from the DOT Framework.
        <p>
            We watched the users interact with the quiz and asked them various questions before and after the quiz to get a firsthand understanding of their experience using the prototype. We also screen-recorded their interaction to see what they were clicking and the movements of their cursor.
        </p>
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>
            Through this project, I learned the importance of user testing and feedback in the development process. Observing how users interacted with our prototype provided valuable insights that we would not have considered otherwise. This hands-on experience highlighted the significance of understanding the target audience and their needs to create an effective and user-friendly product.
        </p>
        <h3>How I Think It Went</h3>
        <p>
            With the helpful information gathered from the user testing, we were able to fix mistakes and tweak our prototype to create a fully functional final product with optimal success. The feedback from high school students was instrumental in refining our study choice test, ensuring that it accurately matched students' profiles and provided useful guidance. Overall, I believe the project went well, and we achieved our goal of creating a tool that will assist future students in making informed decisions about their ICT studies.

    <h2>3rd project – Development (User Testing & User Test Report)</h2>
    <h3>What I did</h3>
    <p>
        In my third group project, we were tasked with revamping the Fontys ICT website to make it more effective in attracting more students. This project was related to our previous project (Media Campaign), so most of the research had already been done, and our ideas for this project were already brainstormed.
    </p>
    <p>
        We were able to dive right in with this new project and begin the design process immediately. Together with my teammate, we started by creating various wireframes and then finalizing a design and creating an interactive prototype for it. Once we had created our Interactive Prototype on Figma, we asked some of our peers to interact with our prototype and share their thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
        User testing is very important as it allows us as developers to see the work through a new set of eyes. During the User Test, we asked the users questions and set up tasks to see if they could navigate the website. Again, the prototyping process is using the <b>Workshop Method</b> while Usibility Testing is using the <b>Lab Method</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        After conducting the user testing on a few individuals, I wrote a user test report to serve as documentation of findings, to use as a tool when communicating with stakeholders, and to have a source of evidence to look back on when making major decisions.
    </p>
    <h3>What I learned</h3>
    <p>
        In conclusion, conducting these user tests aided me in ensuring that the design was aligned with the needs, preferences, and behaviors of the user. It also helped me identify issues such as confusing navigation and unclear calls to action. This experience underscored the value of iterative testing and feedback in the design process
    </p>
    <h3>How I think it went</h3>
    <p>
        Overall, I believe the project went well. By leveraging the research and ideas from our previous project, we were able to efficiently develop a new design for the Fontys ICT website. The user tests provided crucial insights that helped us refine the prototype, ensuring that it met the expectations and needs of prospective students. The user test report was particularly useful for communicating our findings and decisions to stakeholders

    <h2>Portfolio (User Testing & Interactive Prototype)</h2>
    <h3>What I did:</h3>
    <p>After creating various wireframes and prototypes for my portfolio, I developed an interactive prototype using Figma. This process helped me finalize my design and assess the effectiveness of the layouts. It also allowed me to conduct user testing <b>(Lab Method)</b> and receive peer reviews from fellow students <b>(Showroom Method)</b>.</p>
    <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
    <p>User testing and feedback from peers and teachers highlighted small design flaws that I had initially overlooked. This experience underscored the importance of user testing in creating a final product that truly meets users' needs and expectations.</p>
    <h3>How I think It Went:</h3>
    <p>I believe the creation of the Figma prototype went well. It was instrumental in finalizing my design and making final adjustments to the layout before beginning development.</p>
